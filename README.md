Triple Phase LUT Velocity Calculator

This is a simple website tool that helps create velocity curve LUT files for Raw Accel.

This tool lets you change numbers and see the curve live. You can also download the LUT file.

What This Tool Does

This tool makes a velocity curve with three phases.

Phase one gives slow speed control
Phase two makes a smooth change in speed
Phase three gives high speed limit

The curve uses a sigmoid shape so the speed change feels smooth and natural.

Why This Tool Exists

Making LUT files by hand is hard.
This tool lets you change values and see results fast.

It helps players test and build mouse accel curves easily.

How To Use

Open the website

Change the values in the input boxes

Press Generate LUT

Look at the graph

Press Download LUT to save the file

Import the file into Raw Accel

What Each Setting Means

Input Range
Controls how many points the LUT has

Phase 1 Velocity
Speed at the end of phase one

Phase 2 Velocity
Speed at the end of phase two

Phase 3 Velocity
Max speed at the end of phase three

Phase 1 Cap
Where phase one stops

Phase 2 Start
Where phase two begins

Phase 3 Start
Where phase three begins

Smooth Factor
Controls how smooth the curve change feels
Lower value means softer change
Higher value means sharper change
